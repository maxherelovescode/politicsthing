## Reduction Of Schooling Prices Educational Bill
### Educational Bill

Schooling prices should be reduced for children at and under the age of 13 because children of homeless families and some families that don’t earn enough money, don’t receive any education which is unfair for all the children of New Zealand. Stated by Stuff NZ, it costs at most $35,000 for 13 full years of what the government says is free schooling. Stationery is very important for school because it is used to write and store information that the child has learnt during the school year. The average amount stationery costs per year per student is about $513, up from $456 per year. As well as some schools in New Zealand have BYOD which is an acronym for Bring Your Own Device. An average amount for a chromebook suitable for BYOD costs about $529. Even some schools require a certain type of laptop or device which the school asks for and the device costs $1500. Uniforms will also add up to the costs of school for kids. An average cost for school uniforms in New Zealand is $526.50 for girls, while boys’ uniforms will have an average cost of $443. Also, schools require uniforms as “essential”, so if you were going to go to a school, then it would be necessary for the child to wear the school’s uniform. This adds up more and more money to the total cost of schooling.
