## Reduction Of Schooling Prices Educational Bill

### Educational Bill

We agree that the law that schooling costs of attending school, stationary, and requirements should be reduced for homeless and families who earn less than $20,000 each year with children under 13 years old. This is so every child in New Zealand gets the same amount of education as each other and the amount of education needed. As Stated by Stuff NZ, it costs at most $35,000 for 13 full years of what the government says is free schooling. Stationery is very important for school because it is used to write and store information that the child has learnt during the school year. The average amount of stationery costs per year per student is about $513, up from $456 per year. As well as some schools in New Zealand have BYOD which is an acronym for Bring Your Own Device. The average amount for a Chromebook suitable for BYOD costs about $529. Even some schools require a certain type of laptop or device which the school asks for and the device costs $1500. Uniforms will also add up to the costs of school for kids. The average cost for school uniforms in New Zealand is $526.50 for girls, while boys’ uniforms will have an average cost of $443. Also, schools require uniforms as “essential”, so if you were going to go to a school, then it would be necessary for the child to wear the school’s uniform. This adds up more and more money to the total cost of schooling.

## Questions for Education Bill

> What if the child/parent doesn’t want themselves/them to go to school?

Education in New Zealand is compulsory so the child will still have to attend schooling although making it free will be easier for the parent.

> Won’t the government lose a lot of money because they earn money from schooling and education?

Most education in New Zealand is free and stationary money goes to the schools or the company they purchased it from. As well money for trips and out of school experiences to go to the company or place they went to?
