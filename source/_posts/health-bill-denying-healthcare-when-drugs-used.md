### Health Bill

General public health claims will not be accepted if the main cause is negative recreational drugs or alcohol usage. This is because some drugs negatively affect your bodies systems, and can result in your body getting damaged. Alcohol can drastically slow down your time of reaction, it can also cause irrational decision making, this can result in many injuries. According to the world health organization. In the whole entire world around 22 to 30% of non-fatal injuries are related to alcohol usage. 10% to 18% of patients hospitalized have an injury related to alcohol usage. At least 87% of people in the world have health insurance, this results in insurance having to cover 30% of the world's population's health claims, all related to alcohol and drug use. Insurance companies have to pay for the claims that could have been avoided. “Drug use and alcohol use” can be easy alibis for insurance fraud. Removing their access to having claims of their own will remove this problem altogether.

## Questions for Health Law 
 
> Question: How will you know if they have drugs or alcohol in their system? 


Answer: Blood tests will be taken, and we will test their systems. Their pharmacist's name and contact details will be needed when applying for an insurance claim to identify if they have received any medication/drugs. 
Details ( if they have been under the influence before, taken any recreational drug before, and pharmacists receipts) will be needed when getting health insurance and filing their claim.

>Question: Why is this law so important?
  
Answer: This law is important because many insurance companies need to replace and support someone with a health issue or accident, these can be very expensive. Many of these claims and incidents would have been preventable if not intoxicated or have drugs in their system.

>Question: What if the pharmacist or “drug dealer” does not comply or doesn't have a record of the purchases? 

Answer: The claim will either be rejected altogether if there is enough proof of them having an influenced system. Or the claim will be accepted, however, the person responsible for the retail of the alcohol/drugs will receive a warning/and or fine and needs to keep track of their customers' purchases. Or will not be able to sell these select items at all.
